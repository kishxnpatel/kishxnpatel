## About

I focus on reliability, clear fixes, and tidy documentation. Day-to-day that's Windows 10/11, Microsoft 365, AD user/group tasks, imaging (Intune/USB), and common desk-side issues (AV, printers, onboarding, asset updates). I keep ticket hygiene tight (ServiceNow/Jira), write simple KBs, and use light scripting (PowerShell/Python) for inventory/log parsing. I'm comfortable with basic Linux/CLI, networking checks (port/VLAN/DHCP/DNS), and change/incident procedures.

My cybersecurity training means I default to least privilege, patching, and safe configurations; my interest in DevOps has me thinking in terms of automation, logs, and repeatable runbooks. I'm Calgary-based, eligible to work anywhere in Canada, and ready to add value on site or hybrid.

In my spare time, I develop Chrome extensions at **[GetAddons.io](https://getaddons.io)** - turning IT frustrations into productivity tools.
